TODO: User can set thresholds in the mod settings screen.

Example of an `m_mesh.name` that is on when raining, but not when freezing, with fade of `10` and light intensity of `1`:

```
AdditiveShader RemoteControl 10 1 on-during-rain off-during-snow
```

You could maybe use these for highway LED signs or something like that?
